Write an algorithm to create a class Customer that contains 

          fullName(String) and age(int) as variables in class. 

Create a main method, assign values to the variables in the main method and print the values of variables using the object of the main method. 

After writing the algorithm, write suitable code, run the program, and check the output.

 

Algorithm

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Define a class Customer
Step 3: declare Member data fullName(String) 
Step 4: declare Member data age(int)
Step 5: Define public static void main(String args [])
Step 6: define Strig fullName =" Shubham Dixit";
Step 7: define int age =32;
Step 8: instantiate object of class Customer as Customer c1 = new Customer();
Step 9: Print the desired output using the object as System.out.println("the full Name is "+fullName+" and the age is "+age);
Step 10: Stop
