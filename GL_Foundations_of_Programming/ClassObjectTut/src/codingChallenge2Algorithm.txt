Description

    Write an algorithm to implement access modifier functionality. 

Create two separate classes Health & HealthDriver inside  com.greatlearning.corejava; package 

Declare variables age(int), weight(float) & bmi(float) inside class Health as protected.

Display all the variable in class HealthDriver

 

After writing the algorithm, write suitable code, run the program, and check the output.

 

Algorithm

Step 1: Start

Step 2: create package com.greatlearning.corejava
Step 3: Create class Health
Step 3: Declare protected data mambers age(int), weight(float), bmi(float)
Step 4: create class HealthDriver
Step 5: declare main method
step 6: create object of class Health in main
step 7: print all protected data members of class Health using object of class Health created

Step 8: Stop
